# Implement the following classes to understand inheritance in Python:

# Class Name: Employee
# Attributes:
# id (int)
# salary (int)
# Constructor: __init__(self, id, salary) — Initializes the values to respective variables.
# Class Name: SalesEmployee (Subclass of Employee)
# Attributes:
# Inherited from Employee: id, salary
# New attribute: sales (int)
# Constructor: __init__(self, id, salary, sales) — Calls super().__init__(id, salary) to initialize id and salary, and initializes the sales attribute.
# Examples:

# Input: id = 14, salary = 30000, sales = 20
# Output: 
# 14 30000
# 14 30000 20
